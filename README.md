SymPy Beta is a fork of [SymPy Gamma](https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma). The purpose of this project is to run a [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy)-powered, [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com)-like answer engine totally in your browser, without backend computation.

Originally,  
SymPy Beta = SymPy Gamma + (Pyodide - GAE - django) + (Vue + NaiveUI - jQuery)

But as development continues,
it goes [far beyond](doc/changelog.md) SymPy **Gamma**,
although still needs to learn much from the respected model Wolfram|**Alpha**.

That's why I name it SymPy **Beta**.

SymPy Beta is **NOT** an official SymPy project.
