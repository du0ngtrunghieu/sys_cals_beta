# Document
This is a developer doc.

SymPy Beta doesn't provide user doc except for [new feature announcements](changelog.md),
because Wolfram|Alpha users usually don't need it.

If you find anything not intuitive,
please submit an issue.
## I cloned this repo, what's next?
1. [Prepare a develop environment](environment.md).
2. [Run locally and optionally modify it](develop.md).
3. [Optionally deploy it to a server](deploy.md). Remember to provide source code to your users!

You are not required but encouraged to contribute your changes back by making PRs.
